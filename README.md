## The problem

Moodle currently has a tool to migrate a course from one campus to another but it does not allow you to select which elements to migrate nor does it allow you to modify them in the process, so if any changes need to be made to these files, they would have to be done later by hand. On the other hand, Moodle also does not allow you to create a course from scratch with a predefined template.

## The solution

The `Unisync Service (Moodle Migrator Service)` is a very useful product when solving these problems. With this service you can migrate courses in a personalized way from one campus to another as well as create a new course from a specific skeleton or structure.
All types of mod elements that are within a course can be included

## Installation

This service is built with [node][node] and express. And to run it you only need to configure the following environment variables in the path `/.env`:
```
```
Then run the following command:
```
npm start
```
If you want to deploy the application in a Docker container, run the following command:
```
```
